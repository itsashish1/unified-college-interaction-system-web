## Overview

The **Unified College Interaction System** is a full-stack web platform designed to centralize all college-related information and interactions into a single, organized digital hub. It aims to eliminate the fragmentation caused by scattered communication channels — WhatsApp groups, physical notice boards, and informal messages — and replace them with a structured, reliable, and accessible solution for students, faculty, and administrators.

---

## Problem Statement

In most colleges, critical information is spread across multiple unofficial channels, leading to:

- Missed event deadlines and late registrations
- Difficulty finding verified faculty contact details
- No structured platform for academic discussions
- Inefficient, informal announcement methods
- Poor visibility into club activities and college happenings

There is a strong need for a **unified system** that organizes and simplifies these interactions in one place.

---

## Solution

The **Unified College Interaction System** provides:

- A centralized hub for clubs, events, announcements, and faculty details
- Digital event management with online registration and participant tracking
- A structured discussion forum for academic and general queries
- Role-based access for students, club admins, faculty, and system admins
- A scalable and practical platform suited for real-world college deployment
